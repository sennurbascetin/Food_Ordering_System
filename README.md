# Food_Ordering_System
AIM OF OUR PROJECT:
In this project, we designed a system that used only for 1 customer.This
customer can login into the system easily and choose options from the Menu
console we created.User can add the foods whatever want into the Order List.At
the end ,this List and the total price is shown.
DESCRIPTION OF OUR PROJECT:
At the first step of our project,we present the login part to the
customer.Customer can easily access to the system entering name,surname and
username.The reason why we allows that just one customer access the system is
that because we have no database for customers.Otherwise,we could create a
Customer List.We created an ArrayList called as basket to ordered foods be
collected.At the end we present the one payment options which is pay at the
door for customer.
